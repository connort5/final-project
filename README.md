# Drug Poisoning Mortality Rates and Excess Deaths from the Five Leading Causes of Death

## Group Members : Jamie Fong, Connor Tatman, Sangwon Yoon, Esha Gulati

```
The two datasets that our group chose to analyze are Drug Poisoning Mortality Rates and Excess Deaths from the Five
Leading Causes of Death. This domain is worth analyzing because the two datasets can be compared to figure out
whether excess deaths or poisoning have a larger impact on the United States mortality rate. Furthermore, by
critically assessing the data, we can potentially figure out possible measures that could be taken to best address
mortality rates from these causes in the United States that could prevent deaths and lower the mortality rate.

This repo contains the code for making the shiny app that is our final project. The starter code was
imported from the previous work done on a6.
